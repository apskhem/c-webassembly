### Data Types

* `i32`: The 32-bit signed integer type.
* `i64`: The 64-bit signed integer type.
* `f32`: The 32-bit floating point type.
* `f32`: The 64-bit floating point type.
* Tuples: A tuple is a collection of values of different types. Tuples are constructed using parentheses `()`, and each tuple itself is a value with type signature `(T1, T2, ...)`, where `T1`, `T2` are the types of its members. Functions can use tuples to return multiple values, as tuples can hold any number of values.
* `fref`: The function reference type.
* `xref`: The external reference type.
